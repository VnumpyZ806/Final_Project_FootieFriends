This project report explores the development and implementation of "FootieFriends," a web-based platform for football game bookings. 
The project aims to create a user-friendly, responsive website that simplifies the process of organising and joining casual football games. 
The platform provides an intuitive booking system, user registration, and attendance tracking, while integrating a robust backend database using PHPMyAdmin, hosted on the Web Space Kit domain.
The project was inspired by similar event management platforms such as Sportas and Meetup but was designed exclusively for football games to focus on the sports-specific logistics. 
The website allows users to sign up, browse available games, register for matches, and track past and upcoming games. The backend database securely stores user data, ensuring seamless frontend-backend integration.
The Waterfall Development Model was used to guide the project through planning, requirement analysis, design, implementation, testing, and deployment. 
The frontend was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend database was developed with PHP and MySQL. The project underwent rigorous unit, integration, and user acceptance testing to validate system functionality and security.
Beyond technical implementation, "FootieFriends" fosters community-building and reduces financial barriers to sports participation through a pay-as-you-go model. 
Future scalability includes mobile app development and AI-powered game recommendations. This report evaluates the projectâ€™s technical execution, societal impact, and potential for further expansion, demonstrating how "FootieFriends" bridges the gap between casual football enthusiasts and accessible game opportunities.

Attached are code files that were used to compile the webpage. In addition, Project Artefact word document is attached which contains snippets and screenshots of all webside pages, PHPMyAdmin database and HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PHP code snippets (The project Artefact was submitted originally as part of the Full Projet Report).
